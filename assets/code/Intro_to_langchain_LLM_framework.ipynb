        "\n",
        "Large Language Models (LLMs) entered the world stage with the release of OpenAI’s GPT-3 in 2020 [1]. Since then, they’ve enjoyed a steady growth in popularity.\n",
        "\n",
        "That is until late 2022. Interest in LLMs and the broader discipline of generative AI has skyrocketed. The reasons for this are likely the continuous upward momentum of significant advances in LLMs.\n",
        "\n",
        "We saw the dramatic news about Google’s “sentient” LaMDA chatbot. The first high-performance and open-source LLM called BLOOM was released. OpenAI released their next-generation text embedding model and the next generation of “GPT-3.5” models.\n",
        "\n",
        "After all these giant leaps forward in the LLM space, OpenAI released ChatGPT — thrusting LLMs into the spotlight.\n",
        "\n",
        "LangChain appeared around the same time. Its creator, Harrison Chase, made the first commit in late October 2022. Leaving a short couple of months of development before getting caught in the LLM wave.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite being early days for the library, it is already packed full of incredible features for building amazing tools around the core of LLMs. In this article, we’ll introduce the library and start with the most straightforward component offered by LangChain — LLMs.\n",
